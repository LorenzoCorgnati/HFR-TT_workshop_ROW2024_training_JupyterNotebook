# HFR-TT_workshop_ROW2024_training_JupyterNotebook
This Python-based Jupyter notebook (EU_HFR_NODE_ROW24.ipynb) focuses on providing basic routines for testing the processing and QC parameters for the operational workflow of the European HFR Node (https://www.hfrnode.eu/). The operational routines of the European HFR Node are available on the GitHub repository https://github.com/LorenzoCorgnati/EU_HFR_NODE_pyHFR.

For doing this you will provide sample radial and total files from the HFR network you manage. The sample files shall be saved in the data folder with the following folder tree: [1] data/HFR-network/Radials_ruv/stationID for radials measured by Codar systems, [2] data/HFR-network/Radials_asc/stationID for radials measured by WERA systems, [3] data/HFR-network/Totals_tuv for totals generated by Codar Radial Combine Suite, [4] data/HFR-network/Totals_asc for totals generated by WERA systems.

The comprehensive information about HFR networks and stations are read from the operational database of the European HFR Node. In order to insert or modify the information stored in the database, please use the online webform of the European HFR Node (https://webform.hfrnode.eu/).

The required packages are:
- pandas
- datetime
- xarray
- glob
- os
- pickle
- matplotlib
- zipfile
- numpy
- cartopy
- scipy
- shapely
- geopy
